        "definition": "<p>The data shown in the “Financing and investment dynamics” network graph are taken from the sector accounts, which present a complete and consistent set of quarterly data for all resident institutional sectors. The graph shows the financial interconnectedness within and between institutional sectors and between them and the rest of the world. It presents financial positions between sectors (data on flows are also available in the ECB’s public databases). The origin of the financing type – equity or debt – and the destination of the same instrument show how sectors allocate financing. The bars for each sector show the assets and liabilities of a given sector for a given instrument. Negative outstanding amounts could appear due to short selling, i.e. the sale of securities or other financial instruments that are not owned by the seller. The arrows indicate the positions with other sectors. Positions within sectors are identified next to the sector headings.</p>\r\n<p>Data are based on the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA2010). Sectors: non-financial corporations, monetary financial institutions, investment funds (other than money market funds), other financial institutions, insurance corporations, pension funds, general government, households (including non-profit institutions serving households), rest of the world (which refers to positions between residents and non-residents). Instruments: deposits, short-term debt securities, long-term debt securities, short-term loans, long-term loans, listed shares, investment fund shares/units. Data are on a non-consolidated basis, i.e. instrument totals and percentages include intra-sector financial positions (e.g. loans granted by banks to other banks); closing balance sheet positions are at end of quarter; data are neither seasonally adjusted nor calendar-adjusted; amounts are denominated in billions of euros; short-term original maturity is up to one year, long-term original maturity is over one year or no stated maturity; data are for the euro area aggregate, \"-\" means that data do not exist/data are not applicable.   </p>\r\n<p>The instruments shown do not give a complete account of all financial assets and liabilities, as currency, unlisted shares and other equity, insurance and pension schemes, financial derivatives and other accounts receivable/payable are not shown.
